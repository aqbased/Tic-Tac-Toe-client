## Planning Story

First thing first, I wanted to get a wireframe up to guide my styling and potential
functionality of the game.  After getting my browser template set up I then worked
on getting the authentication API calls, forms and functions working properly.  My next objective
was to design a simple game board to play on, inside the Html file.  After acheiving
that I worked on the game API calls, buttons and functions working properly.  After the
functionality met minimum requirement I planned to work on styling.  Most of the problems
I ran in to were due to minor syntax errors.  Eventually I would carefully scan over code
and read it to double check and avoid any errors.  Whenever I ran into roadblocks,
I would spend most of my time reviewing old lessons and then searching google for different
solutions.  Last but not least I had my team of instructors to point me in the right direction
of a potential solution.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up upon loading the page.
- As a user I want to Create a new game after being signed in.
- As a user I want to Read multiple games I've played in the past and see if I completed them or not.
- As a user I want to Update a gameboard as I click on it.
- As a user I want to change a password after being signed in.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to add styling to the page.
- Would like to eventually have a Win Tracker below the game board.
- Would like to eventually have the X and O tokens to have custom images instead.
